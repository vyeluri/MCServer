MCServer is a Minecraft server that is written in C++ and designed to be efficient with memory and CPU, as well as having a flexible Lua Plugin API.

MCServer can run on Windows, *nix and Android operating systems. This includes Android phones and tablets as well as Raspberry Pis. 

We currently support Release 1.7 and 1.8 (not beta) Minecraft protocol versions.

Installation
------------
Hosted MCServer is available DIY on DigitalOcean: [![Install on DigitalOcean](http://doinstall.bearbin.net/button.svg)](http://doinstall.bearbin.net/install?url=https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer) and [Gamososm](https://gamocosm.com) also offers MCServer support.

For Linux there is an easy installation method, just run this in your terminal:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mc-server/MCServer/master/easyinstall.sh | sh

For Windows, you just need to download a file and extract it:

 - [Windows 32 bit](http://builds.cuberite.org/job/MCServer%20Windows%20x86/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/Install/MCServer.zip)
 - [Windows 64 bit](http://builds.cuberite.org/job/MCServer%20Windows%20x64/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/Install/MCServer.zip)

For other operating systems you need to download and compile yourself. There is also an archive of binary builds on the buildserver: http://builds.cuberite.org

Compiling the server yourself has other benefits: you may get better performance performance (1.5-3x as fast) and it supports more operating systems. See the [COMPILING.md](https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer/blob/master/COMPILING.md) file for more details.
